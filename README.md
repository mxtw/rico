"**OCI** **R**untime" in reverse = **rico**

## About this project

**rico** is an attempt at a minimal implementation of a container runtime in Rust.
The goal is to learn more about Rust, container runtimes and the OCI specs.

### Current Focus

For now, I want to be able to run very basic containers. Depending on
future motivation, I may continue working on compliance with the [oci-runtime spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec).

### Caveats

This project is not and will likely never be a production-ready OCI runtime.
It only exists as a personal learning and exploration project.
